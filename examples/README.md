# Example Programs

* pico: the original example programs for the RP2040
* v2
  * pico: example programs for version 2 of Oberon RTK for the Pico board
  * pico2: same for the Pico 2 board

Remarks:
* Some example programs for the Pico can be compiled for the Pico 2 by using the corresponding config file. If so, this is indicated in the file header.
* Eventually, the original examples will be moved into a directory v1 (as with the config files), but doing this now would break all links on the website.
