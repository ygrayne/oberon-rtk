# Oberon RTK Modules Library lib/v3.0

lib/v3.0, work in progress, with the addition of support for NXP and ST MCUs. Based on this work, the structure of the modules for the RPx MCUs may change as well.

The module libraries should be consistent for each MCU, with the corresponding example programs ported to lib/v3.0 compiling and working. However, there are differences across the libraries for different MCUs.
