# Oberon RTK

**Oberon RTK is a framework for writing dual-core, multi-threaded embedded [control programs](https://oberon-rtk.org/concepts/basics/about-rts/) in Oberon for the RP-series of micro-controllers of Raspberry Pi, using Astrobe's cross-compiling IDEs.**

* [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/silicon.html#rp2040): Cortex-M0+, ARMv6-M, Pico 1 board
* [RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/silicon.html#rp2350): Cortex-M33, ARMv8-M, Pico 2 board

Oberon RTK provides an embedded multi-threading kernel to allow to divide, and program, the controller program as set of separate [control processes](https://oberon-rtk.org/concepts/basics/control-processes/).

The use of the kernel is not mandatory for the Oberon RTK library/framework in general, which can be used to program any kind of application using one or two cores..
